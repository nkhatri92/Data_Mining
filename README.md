Instructions to run the code 
Steps:
     
1.	System requirements- A number of libraries are pre-installed with anaconda. The following libraries will be required to run the code and might have to be installed separately: NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, xgboost. The installation of xgboost is a little problematic hence the code is attached in a different file and instruction to install xgboost on Mac OS will be posted separately on github. Since itâ€™s a separate code, xgboost installation can be skipped and the main code can be run for results except attribute selection. 
2.	Download the credit card csv file from my github link https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud/downloads/creditcardfraud.zip
3.	Download the code on your system, file name Final_Project_Code.py
4.	Place the code and the data in the same folder
5.	Open the code in any IDE of your choice
6.	Go to the part of the code where I read the data into a data frame. Here you will have to enter the path where you saved the file. 
7.	The code will run, it starts with the output in 2 minutes and takes 15-25 minutes for full run depending on the machine.
